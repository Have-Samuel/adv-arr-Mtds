- There will be no projects in this unit

- focusing on practical manipulations of the array data structure. You may struggle with these concepts when we introduce them to you, and that’s fine. Just remember, it’s like eating your vegetables - you may not love them at first, but they’re good for your growth, and you’ll eventually acquire a taste for them.

- In particular, you will use these skills in later units to refactor the code on some of your earlier projects - essentially rewriting the code more professionally and in a modern way.
